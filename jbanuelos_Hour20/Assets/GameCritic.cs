/* Game Critic

1) The game is too wasy because the obstacles move very slow even witht the limited view from the camera angle.
Another reason why the game is too easy is because the obstacles are extremely small. This combined with the slow speed makes it easy avoid.

2) I would make the obstacles vary in speed and size.

3) A change in scenary and more attractive particles would the game pop more.

4) Avoiding obstacles and reaching for extremely hard and risky powerups makes the game fun.

5) The sluggish movements and lack of fianl reward make the game tedious.

10 a) obstacle got spiked added to it  

10 b) power up got a model change with a power up aura and a hourglass
